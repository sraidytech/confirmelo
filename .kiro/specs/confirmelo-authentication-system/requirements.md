# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Confirmelo Authentication System serves as the foundational security layer for a revolutionary SaaS platform that transforms e-commerce order confirmation management through automated, non-phone-based processes. This enterprise-grade authentication system must support a sophisticated multi-role ecosystem designed to handle the complete confirmation workflow from order import to delivery tracking. The system will manage authentication and authorization for up to 40 internal users across multiple roles (Admin, Team Leader, Call Center Agent, Follow-up Agent) and 50+ client organizations annually (Client Admin, Client User), delivering 25% improvement in confirmation rates with 40% cost reduction compared to traditional methods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to register my organization and create an admin account with comprehensive role-based permissions, so that I can establish my team structure and begin managing e-commerce order confirmations through the Confirmelo platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organization admin accesses the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive form requiring organization details (name, business email, phone, address, business type) and admin user details (firstName, lastName, email, password, phone)
2. WHEN the admin submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create the organization with unique identifier, create admin user account with ADMIN role, and initialize default system configurations (assignment algorithms, reminder sequences)
3. WHEN the admin submits invalid data THEN the system SHALL display specific validation errors with field-level feedback and business rule explanations
4. WHEN the registration is successful THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email with account activation link, create audit log entry, and redirect to login page with success message
5. IF the email already exists in the system THEN the system SHALL return a secure error message without revealing existing account details
6. WHEN the organization is created THEN the system SHALL initialize default settings for order assignment rules, communication templates, and shipping integrations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user with specific role permissions, I want to log in with my credentials and access my role-specific dashboard with real-time features, so that I can efficiently perform my order confirmation responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the login page THEN the system SHALL display email and password fields with "Remember me" option, language switcher (EN/FR), and forgot password link
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user, issue JWT tokens (access: 15min, refresh: 7 days), create Redis session, and log security event
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a generic error message, implement progressive delays, and log failed attempt without revealing specific field errors
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect to role-specific dashboard (Admin: system overview, Agent: order queue, Client: analytics dashboard) with real-time WebSocket connection
5. WHEN the "Remember me" option is selected THEN the system SHALL extend refresh token validity to 30 days and store preference in Redis
6. IF a user exceeds 10 login attempts per minute THEN the system SHALL implement temporary account lockout with exponential backoff and notify administrators
7. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL update their online status, initialize WebSocket connection for real-time features, and load role-specific permissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user working with real-time order confirmations, I want seamless session management with automatic token refresh and WebSocket connectivity, so that I can work uninterrupted during peak order processing times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh it using the refresh token without interrupting user workflow or WebSocket connections
2. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL issue new access and refresh tokens, invalidate the old refresh token, update Redis session, and maintain WebSocket connection continuity
3. WHEN a refresh token expires or is invalid THEN the system SHALL gracefully disconnect WebSocket, clear Redis session, and redirect to login page with session timeout message
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate both tokens, clear Redis session, disconnect WebSocket, update online status to offline, and log security event
5. WHEN a user's session is active THEN the system SHALL store session data in Redis including user permissions, organization context, assigned stores/teams, and WebSocket connection metadata
6. WHEN multiple sessions exist for the same user THEN the system SHALL support concurrent sessions with independent token management and session tracking
7. WHEN session data is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate Redis session integrity and automatically refresh expired session components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing a complex multi-role ecosystem, I want comprehensive role-based access control with granular permissions and resource-level security, so that users can only access orders, analytics, and system features appropriate to their specific role and assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL determine their role, load associated permissions, and establish resource-level access controls based on store/team/client assignments
2. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected resource THEN the system SHALL verify role permissions, validate resource-level access (store, team, client scope), and check feature-specific permissions
3. WHEN a user lacks permission for a resource THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error with appropriate user-friendly message and log the access attempt
4. WHEN role permissions are evaluated THEN the system SHALL support six distinct roles: Admin (full system access), Team Leader (assigned team scope), Call Center Agent (order confirmation interface), Follow-up Agent (reminder management), Client Admin (organization management), and Client User (read-only access)
5. IF a user's role or assignments change THEN the system SHALL update their permissions immediately, refresh Redis session, and notify active WebSocket connections without requiring re-login
6. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL support granular controls including order access by store/client, analytics scope, user management capabilities, system configuration access, and integration management
7. WHEN resource-level security is enforced THEN the system SHALL ensure Team Leaders only access assigned stores, Agents only see assigned orders, and Client users only view their organization's data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user handling sensitive customer order data and business information, I want enterprise-grade security with robust password protection and comprehensive audit trails, so that my account and organization's e-commerce data remain secure against threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a password THEN the system SHALL enforce complexity requirements (minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character), validate against common password lists, and provide real-time strength feedback
2. WHEN a password is stored THEN the system SHALL hash it using bcrypt with configurable salt rounds (minimum 12), store hash securely, and never log or transmit plaintext passwords
