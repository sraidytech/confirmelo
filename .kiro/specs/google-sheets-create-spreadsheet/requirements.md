# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a "Create New Spreadsheet" button to the Google Sheets spreadsheet selector that creates a new Google Spreadsheet directly from the app with pre-configured headers and structure. This solves the issue where users can't see their existing spreadsheets due to the `drive.file` OAuth2 scope limitations.
