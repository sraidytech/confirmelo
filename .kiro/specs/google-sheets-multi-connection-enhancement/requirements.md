# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the Google Sheets integration to address three critical limitations:

1. **Token Expiration Issue**: Access tokens currently expire every 1 hour, causing frequent authentication failures
2. **Single Sheet Limitation**: Users can only connect to one spreadsheet per connection, limiting workflow flexibility
3. **Single Account Limitation**: Users can only have one Google account connection at a time, preventing multi-account workflows

These enhancements will significantly improve user experience by providing persistent authentication, multi-sheet access, and multi-account support for Google Sheets integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Persistent Token Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Google Sheets connection to remain active without frequent re-authentication, so that I can work uninterrupted without token expiration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Google Sheets access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the token using the refresh token
2. WHEN a refresh token is available THEN the system SHALL use it to obtain new access tokens without user intervention
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL mark the connection as expired and notify the user
4. WHEN a connection is marked as expired THEN the system SHALL provide a clear re-authentication flow
5. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the token expiration time and maintain connection status as active
6. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL automatically handle token refresh if the current token is expired or about to expire

### Requirement 2: Multiple Spreadsheet Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to multiple Google Spreadsheets within a single Google account connection, so that I can manage data across different sheets without creating separate connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have an active Google Sheets connection THEN I SHALL be able to connect to multiple spreadsheets simultaneously
2. WHEN I connect to a new spreadsheet THEN it SHALL be added to my list of connected spreadsheets without disconnecting existing ones
3. WHEN I view my Google Sheets connection THEN I SHALL see a list of all connected spreadsheets with their names and connection status
4. WHEN I disconnect from a specific spreadsheet THEN only that spreadsheet SHALL be removed from the connection while others remain active
5. WHEN I select a spreadsheet for operations THEN I SHALL be able to choose from all my connected spreadsheets
6. WHEN I create a new spreadsheet THEN it SHALL automatically be added to my connected spreadsheets list
7. WHEN I import an existing spreadsheet THEN it SHALL be added to my connected spreadsheets list if access is granted

### Requirement 3: Multiple Google Account Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect multiple Google accounts simultaneously, so that I can access spreadsheets from different Google accounts (personal, work, client accounts) within the same application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to add a new Google Sheets connection THEN I SHALL be able to create multiple connections with different Google accounts
2. WHEN I have multiple Google account connections THEN each connection SHALL be clearly labeled with the associated Google account email
3. WHEN I view my platform connections THEN I SHALL see all Google Sheets connections listed separately with their respective account information
4. WHEN I select a connection for spreadsheet operations THEN I SHALL be able to choose which Google account connection to use
5. WHEN I create or access spreadsheets THEN the system SHALL use the correct Google account based on my selection
6. WHEN I revoke one Google account connection THEN other Google account connections SHALL remain unaffected
7. WHEN I authenticate a new Google account THEN it SHALL create a separate connection without affecting existing connections

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Connection Management UI

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface to manage multiple Google account connections and their associated spreadsheets, so that I can easily organize and access my Google Sheets integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the platform connections page THEN I SHALL see all Google Sheets connections grouped by account with clear visual distinction
2. WHEN I expand a Google account connection THEN I SHALL see all connected spreadsheets for that account
3. WHEN I want to add a new Google account THEN I SHALL have a clear "Add Another Google Account" option
4. WHEN I manage spreadsheets THEN I SHALL be able to connect/disconnect spreadsheets for each account independently
5. WHEN I view connection details THEN I SHALL see account-specific information including email, connected spreadsheets count, and last sync status
6. WHEN I perform spreadsheet operations THEN I SHALL have a clear account selector to choose which Google account to use

### Requirement 5: Improved Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when authentication or connection issues occur, so that I can quickly resolve problems and continue working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token refresh fails THEN I SHALL receive a clear notification explaining the issue and steps to resolve it
2. WHEN a spreadsheet becomes inaccessible THEN I SHALL be notified with specific error details and recovery options
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN I SHALL have a one-click re-authentication option that preserves my existing spreadsheet connections
4. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help and troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN I re-authenticate THEN my previously connected spreadsheets SHALL be automatically reconnected if access is still available
6. WHEN multiple connections have issues THEN I SHALL be able to resolve them individually without affecting working connections

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current Google Sheets connections to continue working after the enhancement, so that I don't lose access to my existing integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN existing Google Sheets connections SHALL continue to function without user intervention
2. WHEN I have an existing single-spreadsheet connection THEN it SHALL be automatically migrated to the new multi-spreadsheet format
3. WHEN I access my existing connection THEN I SHALL see my previously connected spreadsheet in the new interface
4. WHEN I use existing API endpoints THEN they SHALL continue to work with the enhanced connection model
5. WHEN I perform operations on existing connections THEN the behavior SHALL remain consistent with previous functionality
