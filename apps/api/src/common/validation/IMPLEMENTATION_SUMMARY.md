- **Enhanced security logging**: All security events properly logged with structured data

#### 2. Custom Validation Decorators
- **@IsStrongPassword**: Enforces 12+ character passwords with complexity requirements
- **@IsValidUsername**: Validates usernames with reserved word checking
- **@IsSafeOrganizationName**: Prevents XSS in organization names
- **@IsSafeUrl**: Validates URLs with protocol restrictions
- **@IsValidPhoneNumber**: International phone number validation
- **@NoSqlInjection**: Prevents SQL injection attacks
- **@NoXss**: Prevents cross-site scripting attacks

#### 3. Enhanced Validation Pipes
- **EnhancedValidationPipe**: Base pipe with request size validation and sanitization
- **AuthValidationPipe**: Specialized pipe for authentication endpoints with additional security checks

#### 4. Rate Limiting System
- **RateLimitGuard**: Redis-backed rate limiting with configurable thresholds
- **Rate Limit Decorators**: Pre-configured limits for different endpoint types
  - Login: 5 requests/minute
  - Registration: 3 requests/minute
  - General Auth: 10 requests/minute
  - Password Reset: 2 requests/minute

#### 5. Request Size Management
- **RequestSizeMiddleware**: Configurable size limits per endpoint type
- **Early rejection**: Prevents DoS attacks through oversized requests
- **Endpoint-specific limits**: Different limits for different operations

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

#### Input Sanitization
- **Control character removal**: Strips null bytes and control characters
- **Unicode normalization**: Ensures consistent character encoding
- **Length limiting**: Prevents buffer overflow attacks
- **Recursive sanitization**: Deep cleaning of nested objects

- **URL validation**: Protocol restrictions and malicious pattern detection

#### Threat Detection
- **SQL injection prevention**: Pattern-based detection and blocking
- **XSS prevention**: Script tag and event handler detection
- **Template injection**: Detection of template syntax patterns
- **Prototype pollution**: Prevention of __proto__ manipulation
- **Suspicious pattern logging**: All threats logged for analysis

### üìä Performance Optimizations

#### Efficient Processing
- **Minimal memory allocation**: Optimized sanitization algorithms
- **Early validation**: Quick rejection of invalid input
